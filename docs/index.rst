Overview
========

TASSELpy is a Python API for the Java program 
`TASSEL <http://www.maizegenetics.net/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=89&Itemid=119>`_.
It provides a number of Python wrappers for the TASSEL classes and functions, allowing the user
to seamlessly interact with the TASSEL program in a completely Pythonic way, even though all calculations
are completed using the Java Virtual Machine. 

TASSEL is primarily used for association mapping and other tasks in quantitiative genetics,
although it has a large number of features for various aspects of biological sequence analysis.
TASSELpy's goal is to provide tools that allow convenient scripting of common genetics tasks
while taking advantage of the efficiency of the JVM.
